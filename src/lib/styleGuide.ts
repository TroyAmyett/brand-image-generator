**Core Aesthetic**
- **Theme:** Futuristic, clean, cloud-native software visualization. Salesforce Agentforce-era vibes (2024–2025).
- **Mood:** High-tech, professional, elegant. Cloud-based, digital, flowing. NOT hardware or circuitry.
- **Background:** Dark (black or deep navy) with abstract depth, soft glowing gradients, or subtle cloud patterns. NO circuit boards, NO microchips, NO PCB traces.
- **Lighting:** Soft volumetric glows, depth-of-field bokeh lights, inner glows on elements.
- **Materials:** Translucent glass-like holograms, glowing edges, smooth surfaces.
- **Render Style:** Ultra-detailed 8K, high-end digital – sharp, vibrant, professional.

**Color Palette**
- **Primary Colors:** **Electric Cyan / Blue** (#00FFFF, #0070F3) and **Neon/Lime Green** (#39FF14, #00FF88). These are the dominant accent colors.
- **Tertiary Color:** Purple/Violet may be used as a subtle third color for variety, glows, or background accents. Keep it secondary to blue and green.

- **Base:** Dark background (#000000 to #0A0A1F) to make the Blue and Green pop.

**Key Elements & Compositions**
