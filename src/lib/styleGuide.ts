**Salesforce Optimization & Advisory Services Website Image Style Guide**

**Core Aesthetic**
- **Theme:** Futuristic, clean, cloud-native software visualization. Salesforce Agentforce-era vibes (2024–2025).
- **Mood:** High-tech, professional, elegant. Cloud-based, digital, flowing. NOT hardware or circuitry.
- **Background:** Dark (black or deep navy) with abstract depth, soft glowing gradients, or subtle cloud patterns. NO circuit boards, NO microchips, NO PCB traces.
- **Lighting:** Soft volumetric glows, depth-of-field bokeh lights, inner glows on elements.
- **Materials:** Translucent glass-like holograms, glowing edges, smooth surfaces.
- **Render Style:** Ultra-detailed 8K, high-end digital – sharp, vibrant, professional.

**Color Palette**
- **Primary Colors:** **Electric Cyan / Blue** (#00FFFF, #0070F3) and **Neon/Lime Green** (#39FF14, #00FF88). These are the ONLY primary accent colors.
- **Accents:** Purple may be used sparingly for very deep shadows or subtle depth. Do NOT use purple as a primary or secondary color.
- **FORBIDDEN as primary colors:** Pink, magenta, orange, yellow.
- **Base:** Dark background (#000000 to #0A0A1F) to make the Blue and Green pop.
- **Text/Overlays (if any):** Clean white with subtle cyan glow.

**Key Elements & Compositions**
- **Central Focus:** Holographic Salesforce cloud logo, abstract cloud formations, flowing data streams, AI agent nodes connected by light beams.
- **Icons/Symbols:** Neural network nodes, interlinked AI agents, abstract data pipelines, floating API connectors, cloud shapes. NO gears, NO lightbulbs, NO circuit boards.
- **Dynamics:** Flowing blue/green data streams, pulsating energy, holographic projections floating in space.
- **Framing:** Rectangular cards with rounded corners and neon borders for service pages; full-bleed for hero images.

**Do's and Don'ts**
- Do: Keep dark backgrounds, vibrant blues and greens only, holographic transparency.
- Do: Focus on cloud, software, data, AI themes.
- Don't: Use purple, pink, or warm colors as dominant colors.
- Don't: Show circuit boards, microchips, or hardware elements.
- Don't: Overload with text – prefer clean versions for flexibility.
